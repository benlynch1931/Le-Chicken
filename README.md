# Le Chicken

## About 

Le Chicken: The Poulet is a language-learning RPG (role-playing game). The player begins as a chicken, dreaming of making it in the big city. The problem? This chicken doesn’t know French! From start to finish, the user is introduced to and given a chance to contextually use new vocabulary in their target language. While this version is only the ‘tutorial’ area, by the end of the full-game, the user will be able to interact with the game entirely in their target language!
